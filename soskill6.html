	<h1> Resilience </h1>
	<h3><i> The ability to adjust to difficult circumstances is resilience. You still feel wrath, grief, and suffering when faced with stress, hardship, or tragedy, yet you are still able to carry on with your daily activities on a physical and psychological level. It is mental, emotional, and behavioral flexibility and ability.
