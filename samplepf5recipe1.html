<p>Leche Flan or Cr√®me Caramel is a soft, smooth and velvety custard dessert. This is a common dessert all over the world but with different variations.</p>
<p>Ingredients</p>
	<ul type='disc'>
		<li> 10 pieces eggs
		<li> 1 can condensed milk (14 oz)
		<li> 1 cup fresh milk or evaporated milk
		<li> 1 cup granulated sugar
		<li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
	</ul><br>

<p>Procedures</p>
	<ol>
		<li> Using all the eggs, separate the yolk from the egg white (only egg yolks will be used).
		<li> Place the egg yolks in a big bowl then beat them using a fork or an egg beater.
		<li> Add the condensed milk and mix thoroughly.
		<li> Pour-in the fresh milk and Vanilla. Mix well.
		<li> Put the mold (llanera) on top of the stove and heat using low fire.
		<li> Put-in the granulated sugar on the mold and mix thoroughly until the solid sugar turns into liquid (caramel) having a light brown color. Note: Sometimes it is hard to find a Llanera (Traditional flan mold) depending on your location. I find it more convenient to use individual Round Pans in making leche flan.
		<li> Spread the caramel (liquid sugar) evenly on the flat side of the mold.
		<li> Wait for 5 minutes then pour the egg yolk and milk mixture on the mold.
		<li> Cover the top of the mold using an Aluminum foil.
		<li> Steam the mold with egg and milk mixture for 30 to 35 minutes.
		<li> After steaming, let the temperature cool down then refrigerate.
		<li> Serve for dessert. Share and Enjoy!
